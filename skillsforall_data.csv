[Module 1: Introduction to Cybersecurity | 1. The World of Cybersecurity],"[Understanding cybersecurity and why it’s important, Scroll to begin , Hi, my name is Guru. Welcome to eLearning company @Apollo. We’re delighted to have you on board. The company is in a critical growth phase, but we’re worried that we’re susceptible to security breaches., We’ve seen so many companies fall victim to cybercrime, and we don’t want to be next. We need to move quickly and build our cybersecurity defenses. Are you ready to help?, Cybersecurity is the ongoing effort to protect individuals, organizations and governments from digital attacks by protecting networked systems and data from unauthorized use or harm., Select the pin icons to find out more about the three levels of protection., Let’s take a closer look at each of these three levels., Personal data is any information that can be used to identify you, and it can exist both offline and online., Select the images to find out the difference between your offline and online identity., Your offline identity is the real-life persona that you present on a daily basis at home, at school or at work. As a result, family and friends know details about your personal life, including your full name, age and address., It’s important not to overlook the importance of securing your offline identity. Identity thieves can easily steal your data from right under your nose when you’re not looking!, , Your online identity is not just a name. It’s who you are and how you present yourself to others online. It includes the username or alias you use for your online accounts, as well as the social identity you establish and portray on online communities and websites., You should take care to limit the amount of personal information you reveal through your online identity. , , Many people think that if they don’t have any social media or online accounts set up, then they don’t have an online identity. This is not the case. If you use the web, you have an online identity., It’s your first day on the job, and it’s time to choose a username for your online identity. Which of the following options would you choose?, This is your first chance to gain some valuable defender points at eLearning company @Apollo, so take your time and think carefully before making your choices., Choose two correct answers, then Submit., Personal data describes any information about you, including your name, social security number, driver license number, date and place of birth, your mother’s maiden name, and even pictures or messages that you exchange with family and friends., Cybercriminals can use this sensitive information to identify and impersonate you, infringing on your privacy and potentially causing serious damage to your reputation., Select the pins to find out more about how hackers can get their hands on your personal data., This has got you thinking. Only yesterday, you shared a couple of photos of your first day on the job with a few of your close friends. But that should be OK, right? Let’s see…, , , You took some photos at work on your mobile phone. Copies of these photos are now available on your mobile device., , , You shared these with five close friends, who live in various locations across the world., , , All of your friends downloaded the photos and now have copies of your photos on their devices., , One of your friends was so proud that they decided to post and share your photos online. The photos are no longer just on your device. They have in fact ended up on servers located in different parts of the world and people whom you don’t even know now have access to your photos., This is just one example that reminds us that every time we collect or share personal data, we should consider our security. There are different laws that protect your privacy and data in your country. But do you know where your data is?, Select the images for more examples which may not be so obvious., Following an appointment, the doctor will update your medical record. For billing purposes, this information may be shared with the insurance company. In such cases, your medical record, or part of it, is now accessible at the insurance company., , Store loyalty cards may be a convenient way to save money on your purchases. However, the store is using this card to build a profile of your purchasing behavior, which it can then use to target you with special offers from its marketing partners., , Consider how often you use your computing devices to access your personal data. Unless you have chosen to receive paper statements, you probably access digital copies of bank account statements via your bank’s website. And when paying a bill, it’s highly likely that you’ve transferred the required funds via a mobile banking app., But besides allowing you to access your information, computing devices can now also generate information about you., Wearable technologies such as smartwatches and activity trackers collect your data for clinical research, patient health monitoring, and fitness and wellbeing tracking. As the global fitness tracker market grows, so also does the risk to your personal data., It might seem that information available online is free. But is privacy the price we pay for this digital convenience?, For example, social media companies generate the majority of their income by selling targeted advertising based on customer data that has been mined using algorithms or formulas. Of course, these companies will argue that they are not ‘selling’ customer data, but ‘sharing’ customer data with their marketing partners., You can make up your own mind!, So, with all this information about you available online, what do hackers want? Of course, they want your money., Can you think of an example that you have experienced yourself or that you have heard or read about, where cybercriminals have accessed or tried to access financial information online?, Share your example in the box below, then Submit. Once you have entered your example, select Show answer to reveal a summary response., Were you able to think of at least one example?, A cybercriminal can take advantage of your relationships, accessing your online accounts and appealing to your good nature to try and trick you into wiring money to your friends or family in a time of need. For example, there have been many reported cases of hackers impersonating family members and sending messages stating that they need money wired in order to get home from abroad after losing their wallets., And while you may think that your frequent flyer air miles are not valuable to cybercriminals, think again. In 2015, cybercriminals hacked approximately 10,000 American Airlines and United accounts, booking free flights and upgrades using stolen credentials. Even though the frequent flyer miles were returned to the customers by the airlines, this example demonstrates the value of your login credentials., Cybercriminals are certainly very imaginative when it comes to gaining access to your money. But that’s not all they are after — they could also steal your identity and ruin your life., Let’s find out more., Not content with stealing your money for short-term financial gain, cybercriminals are invested in the long-term gain of identity theft., Select the cards for two examples of how they might do this., Rising medical costs have led to an increase in medical identity theft, with cybercriminals stealing medical insurance to use the benefits for themselves. Where this happens, any medical procedures carried out in your name will then be saved in your medical records., , Stealing private data can help cybercriminals access bank accounts, credit cards, social profiles and other online accounts. Armed with this information, an identity thief could file a fake tax return and collect the refund. They could even take out loans in your name and ruin your credit rating (and your life as well)., , It’s not just criminals who seek your personal data., Select the headings below to find out what other entities are interested in your online identity and why., Your ISP tracks your online activity and, in some countries, they can sell this data to advertisers for a profit., In certain circumstances, ISPs may be legally required to share your information with government surveillance agencies or authorities., Targeted advertising is part of the Internet experience. Advertisers monitor and track your online activities such as shopping habits and personal preferences and send targeted ads your way., These platforms gather information about your gender, geolocation, phone number and political and religious ideologies based on your search histories and online identity. This information is then sold to advertisers for a profit., Websites use cookies to track your activities in order to provide a more personalized experience. But this leaves a data trail that is linked to your online identity that can often end up in the hands of advertisers!, It’s obvious that cybercriminals are becoming more sophisticated in their pursuit of valuable personal data. But they also pose a huge threat to organizational data., Select Next to find out more.]"
[Module 1: Introduction to Cybersecurity | 2. Organizational Data],"[Understanding organizational data and why it must be protected, Scroll to begin , Before you can start implementing best practices to safeguard organizational data, you need to know what it is. In organizations like eLearning company @Apollo, there are two main types of data that you should be aware of., Let’s explore these now., Traditional data is typically generated and maintained by all organizations, big and small. It includes the following:, IoT is a large network of physical objects, such as sensors, software and other equipment. All of these ‘things’ are connected to the Internet, with the ability to collect and share data. And given that storage options are expanding through the cloud and virtualization, it’s no surprise that the emergence of IoT has led to an exponential growth in data, creating a new area of interest in technology and business called 'Big Data.', The McCumber Cube is a model framework created by John McCumber in 1991 to help organizations establish and evaluate information security initiatives by considering all of the related factors that impact them. This security model has three dimensions:, Scroll down to find out more about the different elements of each dimension., A concerned customer has forwarded on what they believe to be a fraudulent email. It looks as if it has been sent by @Apollo but something appears a little 'phish-y.', Take a look at the email. Which of the following indicates that it is in fact a phishing email? Don’t forget, you have a chance to earn valuable defender points if you answer this correctly., Select four correct answers, then Submit., Yes, phishing is very common and often works. For example, in August 2020, elite gaming brand Razer experienced a data breach which exposed the personal information of approximately 100,000 customers., A security consultant discovered that a cloud cluster (a group of linked servers providing data storage, databases, networking, and software through the Internet), was misconfigured and exposed a segment of Razer’s infrastructure to the public Internet, resulting in a data leak. , It took Razer more than three weeks to secure the cloud instance from public access, during which time cybercriminals had access to customer information that could have been used in social engineering and fraud attacks, like the one you uncovered just now. , Organizations therefore need to take a proactive approach to cloud security to ensure that sensitive data is secured., The implications of a data security breach are severe, but they are becoming all too common., Select the images to read about two well-known examples., In 2017, an Internet of Things (IoT) botnet, Persirai, targeted over 1,000 different models of Internet Protocol (IP) cameras, accessing open ports to inject a command that forced the cameras to connect to a site which installed malware on them. Once the malware was downloaded and executed, it deleted itself and was therefore able to run in memory to avoid detection., Over 122,000 of these cameras from several different manufacturers were hijacked and used to carry out distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, without the knowledge of their owners. A DDoS attack occurs when multiple devices infected with malware flood the resources of a targeted system., The IoT is connecting more and more devices, creating more opportunities for cybercriminals to attack., , In September 2017, Equifax, a consumer credit reporting agency in the United States, publicly announced a data breach event: Attackers had been able to exploit a vulnerability in its web application software to gain access to the sensitive personal data of millions of customers., In response to this breach, Equifax established a dedicated website that allowed Equifax customers to determine if their information was compromised. However, instead of using a subdomain of equifax.com, the company set up a new domain name, which allowed cybercriminals to create unauthorized websites with similar names. These websites were used to try and trick customers into providing personal information., Attackers could use this information to assume a customer’s identity. In such cases, it would be very difficult for the customer to prove otherwise, given that the hacker is also privy to their personal information., , If you are ever faced with a similar situation, quickly verify if your information was compromised, so that you can minimize the impact. Keep in mind that, in a time of crisis, you may be tricked into using unauthorized websites., Always be vigilant when providing personally identifiable information over the Internet. Check your credit reports regularly and immediately report any false information, such as applications for credit that you did not initiate or purchases on your credit cards that you did not make., These examples show that the potential consequences of a security breach can be severe., Select the headings for a summary of these impacts., A security breach can have a negative long-term impact on an organization’s reputation that has taken years to build. Customers, particularly those who have been adversely affected by the breach, will need to be notified and may seek compensation and/or turn to a reliable and secure competitor. Employees may also choose to leave in light of a scandal., Depending on the severity of a breach, it can take a long time to repair an organization’s reputation., A hacker or hacking group may vandalize an organization’s website by posting untrue information. They might even just make a few minor edits to your organization’s phone number or address, which can be trickier to detect., In either case, online vandalism can portray unprofessionalism and have a negative impact on your organization’s reputation and credibility., A data breach often involves an incident where sensitive personal data has been stolen. Cybercriminals can make this information public or exploit it to steal an individual’s money and/or identity., The financial impact of a security breach can be devastating. For example, hackers can take down an organization’s website, preventing it from doing business online. A loss of customer information may impede company growth and expansion. It may demand further investment in an organization’s security infrastructure. And let’s not forget that organizations may face large fines or penalties if they do not protect online data., A security breach could also have a devastating impact on the competitiveness of an organization, particularly if hackers are able to get their hands on confidential documents, trade secrets and intellectual property., Despite the best of intentions and all the safeguards you can put in place, protecting organizations from every cyberattack is not feasible., Cybercriminals are constantly finding new ways to attack and, eventually, they will succeed., When they do, it will be up to cybersecurity professionals, like you, to respond quickly to minimize its impact., Security breaches can have devastating consequences for an organization. Therefore, it is crucial to take appropriate steps and implement measures to protect against cyber attacks., Select Next to find out more. ]"
[Module 1: Introduction to Cybersecurity | 3. What Was Taken?],"[Lab activity, Scroll to begin , Security breaches today are all too common, with attackers constantly finding new and innovative ways of infiltrating organizations in search of valuable information., Scroll down to read the latest breaking security news headline.*, According to our sources, a well known hotel chain that operates across the world has reported a massive data breach, with the personal information of over three million guests exposed to hackers., The hotel discovered that hackers gained access to its customer database by using the login details of one of its employees., At this point, the hotel doesn’t believe that the hackers were able to access any account passwords or financial information. Recent guests are encouraged to check the hotel chain’s web portal to see if they have been impacted by this breach. , *This is a fictional scenario., In this example, what did the hackers take?, Select the correct answer, then Submit., eLearning Platforms at Risk!, The team at @Apollo is concerned. eLearning platforms are becoming prime targets for attackers as more and more organizations make the move to digital learning., Select the arrows to find out more about a recent case.*, A popular online training platform admitted leaving the personal data of millions of its students (many of them minors) exposed on a publicly accessible cloud database., Hackers were able to directly access students’ full names, email addresses, phone numbers, and school enrollment details from the Internet!, While it’s unclear what the hackers have done with this acquired information, it’s safe to say that they have everything they need to carry out widespread phishing or malware attacks., What exploits did the hackers use in this case to gain access to valuable personal information?, Select the correct answer, then Submit., Every organization is at risk of a cyber attack and therefore must take appropriate action to protect itself., Thinking back to each of the two security breach examples outlined above, what measures could these organizations have implemented in order to have prevented these security breaches?, Write your thoughts in the box below, then Submit. Select Show answer to check your response., In both cases, the organizations need to invest in improved security practices. , This might include:, A security breach is an incident that results in unauthorized access to data, applications, services or devices, exposing private information that attackers can use for financial gain or other advantages., But there are many ways to protect yourself and your organization. It’s important to be aware of common cyber threats and remain vigilant so that you don’t become the next victim., Interested in finding out more?, Search for a few additional examples of recent security breaches. In each case, can you identify:, Record your findings in this document., Given the very real threat to organizational data, it is critical that all organizations develop and implement a comprehensive cybersecurity plan to protect them from potential breaches. But who are they being protected from?, Select Next to find out more.]"
[Module 1: Introduction to Cybersecurity | 4. Cyber Attackers],"[Understanding their goals, motivations and capabilities, Scroll to begin , Attackers are individuals or groups who attempt to exploit vulnerability for personal or financial gain. As we’ve already seen, they are interested in everything, from credit cards to product designs!, Let’s look at some of the main types of cyber attackers who’ll try anything to get their hands on our information. They are often categorized as white hat, gray hat or black hat attackers., Select the pin icons to find out more., Now that you know the different types of attackers and their motivations for doing what they do, can you identify what color of hat is worn by the attacker in each of the following scenarios? This is a tricky one but remember, you can earn valuable defender points if you answer correctly., Select the correct answer from the dropdowns, then Submit., Cyber attacks can originate from within an organization as well as from outside of it., Select the images to find out more., Employees, contract staff or trusted partners can accidentally or intentionally:, , Amateurs or skilled attackers outside of the organization can:, , Remember that phishing email you received earlier from one of your customers?, An investigation into this email revealed that the user accounts and access privileges of a former employee were not fully removed from the IT systems on leaving the company. In fact, this former employee, who now works for a competitor, logged into @Apollo’s customer database only three days ago., Has an internal or external security threat occurred here?, Select an answer, then Submit., The profile of a cyber attacker varies depending on their goals, motivations and capabilities. At the extreme, hackers can launch cyber attacks against nations and states, wreaking havoc on their computer systems and networks., Select Next to continue.]"
[Module 1: Introduction to Cybersecurity | 5. Cyberwarfare],"[Launching digital attacks at a national level, Scroll to begin , Cyberwarfare, as its name suggests, is the use of technology to penetrate and attack another nation’s computer systems and networks in an effort to cause damage or disrupt services, such as shutting down a power grid., One example of a state-sponsored attack involved the Stuxnet malware that was designed not just to hijack targeted computers but to actually cause physical damage to equipment controlled by computers!, Press the play button to watch a short video on the case of Stuxnet and discover the impact this malware had on Iran’s nuclear enrichment plant., This is a modal window., Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window., End of dialog window., This is a modal window. This modal can be closed by pressing the Escape key or activating the close button., You know when it comes to security news, it's always puzzling what gets reported. As viewers of this show, you know there's a very regular rhythm of security issues that are always bubbling just below the surface and it takes something truly profound to grab the public's attention. Well, one new threat making the rounds did have the right mix of ingredients last summer. Stuxnet. I mean it makes sense, right? Computer attacks, nuclear power, foreign governments, sabotage, spy versus spy. But how much of it is real? Enough to say it's a sign of the times., Now as all good threats, the details will continue to evolve, but I do think that there are five items worth paying attention to here. , The first one, non-trivial distribution. Primarily spread via USB sticks. Think non-Internet connected systems that then propagate by escalating privilege levels through zero day exploits, notable for the fact that true zeros are special and they're only valuable for a short period of time. Very expensive, very hard to come by. , The next one, sophistication. This is an intelligent worm. Initially targeting Windows computers, where it even installs its own drivers using a stolen but legitimate certificate. The offending certificate gets revoked of course, but then another one gets added within 24 hours. , Our third point, modular coding. This thing can get new tires while still on the road. Multiple control servers. First in Malaysia, then Denmark, now more, including peer-to-peer. In fact, when two run into each other, they compare versions and make sure that they're both updated. , Fourth point, unique targeting. Windows is just the intermediary, the friend of the friend. Stuxnet is looking for a particular model of PLC. That's programmable logic controller, which is technically not SCADA as it's often reported. These are small imbedded industrial control systems that run all sorts of automated processes, from factories to oil refineries to nuclear power plants. Stuxnet will leverage the vulnerability in the controller software to reach in and change very specific bits of data. Shut things off. Don't grease a bearing for 10 minutes. Don't sound an alarm. This is really unique knowledge. Respectable coding skills that imply a higher level of patience of good funding resources. , Our final point, motive. Stuxnet does not perform... excuse me. It does not threaten. It performs sabotage. Really has no criminal focus. Does not spread indiscriminately or steal credit card information or login credentials. It does not recruit systems into a botnet. It targets infrastructure, our most essential necessities like power, water, safety and much, much more. You know these are older systems. Very established. Generally run with the mentality of hey, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. These things don't get watched over and patched by technical handlers who understand these kind of things. Not yet anyway. So stay tuned. This one is not done. We all have a lot to learn and somebody is working hard to teach us., If you are interested in finding out more, check out this short video, Stuxnet: Anatomy of a Computer Virus, that was produced for Australian TV program HungryBeast. , , The main reason for resorting to cyberwarfare is to gain advantage over adversaries, whether they are nations or competitors., Select the arrows to find out more about how cyberwarfare is used., A nation or international organization can engage in cyberwarfare in order to steal defense secrets and gather information about technology that will help narrow the gaps in its industries and military capabilities., Furthermore, compromised sensitive data can give attackers leverage to blackmail personnel within a foreign government., Besides industrial and military espionage, a nation can continuously invade another nation’s infrastructure in order to cause disruption and chaos., For example, a cyber attack could shut down the power grid of a major city. Consider the consequences if this were to happen; roads would be congested, the exchange of goods and services would be halted, patients would not be able to get the care they would need if an emergency occurred, access to the internet would be interrupted. By shutting down a power grid, a cyber attack could have a huge impact on the everyday life of ordinary citizens., Cyberwarfare can destabilize a nation, disrupt its commerce, and cause its citizens to lose faith and confidence in their government without the attacker ever physically setting foot in the targeted country., Cyberwarfare is a very serious issue with potentially devastating consequences, and attacks are becoming more widespread. Now, more than ever, nations and governments need cybersecurity professionals to help protect their citizens and infrastructure.

"[Module 2: Attacks, Concepts and Techniques | 1. Analyzing a Cyber Attack]","[Understanding common types of attack, Scroll to begin , Cybercriminals use many different types of malicious software, or malware, to carry out their activities. Malware is any code that can be used to steal data, bypass access controls, or cause harm to or compromise a system. Knowing what the different types are and how they spread is key to containing and removing them., Select the headings to find out more about some of the most common malware., Designed to track and spy on you, spyware monitors your online activity and can log every key you press on your keyboard, as well as capture almost any of your data, including sensitive personal information such as your online banking details. Spyware does this by modifying the security settings on your devices., It often bundles itself with legitimate software or Trojan horses., Adware is often installed with some versions of software and is designed to automatically deliver advertisements to a user, most often on a web browser. You know it when you see it! It’s hard to ignore when you’re faced with constant pop-up ads on your screen., It is common for adware to come with spyware., This type of malware is used to gain unauthorized access by bypassing the normal authentication procedures to access a system. As a result, hackers can gain remote access to resources within an application and issue remote system commands., A backdoor works in the background and is difficult to detect., This malware is designed to hold a computer system or the data it contains captive until a payment is made. Ransomware usually works by encrypting your data so that you can’t access it., Some versions of ransomware can take advantage of specific system vulnerabilities to lock it down. Ransomware is often spread through phishing emails that encourage you to download a malicious attachment or through a software vulnerability., This is a type of malware that uses 'scare’ tactics to trick you into taking a specific action. Scareware mainly consists of operating system style windows that pop up to warn you that your system is at risk and needs to run a specific program for it to return to normal operation., If you agree to execute the specific program, your system will become infected with malware., This malware is designed to modify the operating system to create a backdoor, which attackers can then use to access your computer remotely. Most rootkits take advantage of software vulnerabilities to gain access to resources that normally shouldn’t be accessible (privilege escalation) and modify system files., Rootkits can also modify system forensics and monitoring tools, making them very hard to detect. In most cases, a computer infected by a rootkit has to be wiped and any required software reinstalled., A virus is a type of computer program that, when executed, replicates and attaches itself to other executable files, such as a document, by inserting its own code. Most viruses require end-user interaction to initiate activation and can be written to act on a specific date or time., Viruses can be relatively harmless, such as those that display a funny image. Or they can be destructive, such as those that modify or delete data., Viruses can also be programmed to mutate in order to avoid detection. Most viruses are spread by USB drives, optical disks, network shares or email., This malware carries out malicious operations by masking its true intent. It might appear legitimate but is, in fact, very dangerous. Trojans exploit your user privileges and are most often found in image files, audio files or games., Unlike viruses, Trojans do not self-replicate but act as a decoy to sneak malicious software past unsuspecting users., This is a type of malware that replicates itself in order to spread from one computer to another. Unlike a virus, which requires a host program to run, worms can run by themselves. Other than the initial infection of the host, they do not require user participation and can spread very quickly over the network., Worms share similar patterns: They exploit system vulnerabilities, they have a way to propagate themselves, and they all contain malicious code (payload) to cause damage to computer systems or networks., Worms are responsible for some of the most devastating attacks on the Internet. In 2001, the Code Red worm had infected over 300,000 servers in just 19 hours., So now you know about the different kinds of malware. But what do you think their symptoms might be?, Take a pause and see what you can come up with, and when you’re ready, select the image to reveal some possible answers., Regardless of the type of malware a system has been infected with, there are some common symptoms to look out for. These include:, , This is exactly what could be happening at @Apollo!, Based on what you now know, do you think you could spot the different types of malware from their descriptions?, Let’s see!, Match each of the descriptions to the correct malware type by selecting an answer from each dropdown, then Submit., There are many different malware types that pose a threat to your organization but how can cybercriminals get into your networks and systems in the first place? They have many means at their disposal., Select Next to continue.]"
"[Module 2: Attacks, Concepts and Techniques | 2. Methods of Infiltration]","[How cybercriminals carry out an attack, Scroll to begin , Social engineering is the manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. Social engineers often rely on people’s willingness to be helpful, but they also prey on their weaknesses. For example, an attacker will call an authorized employee with an urgent problem that requires immediate network access and appeal to the employee’s vanity or greed or invoke authority by using name-dropping techniques in order to gain this access., Select the arrows to find out more about some common types of social engineering attacks., This is when an attacker calls an individual and lies to them in an attempt to gain access to privileged data., For example, pretending to need a person’s personal or financial data in order to confirm their identity., This is when an attacker quickly follows an authorized person into a secure, physical location., This is when an attacker requests personal information from a person in exchange for something, like a free gift., Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks are a type of network attack that is relatively simple to carry out, even by an unskilled attacker. A DoS attack results in some sort of interruption of network service to users, devices or applications., Select the images to find out more about the two main types of DoS attacks. , This is when a network, host or application is sent an enormous amount of data at a rate which it cannot handle. This causes a slowdown in transmission or response, or the device or service to crash., , A packet is a collection of data that flows between a source and a receiver computer or application over a network, such as the Internet. When a maliciously formatted packet is sent, the receiver will be unable to handle it., For example, if an attacker forwards packets containing errors or improperly formatted packets that cannot be identified by an application, this will cause the receiving device to run very slowly or crash., , DoS attacks are considered a major risk because they can easily interrupt communication and cause significant loss of time and money., A Distributed DoS (DDoS) attack is similar to a DoS attack but originates from multiple, coordinated sources. For example:, A bot computer is typically infected by visiting an unsafe website or opening an infected email attachment or infected media file. A botnet is a group of bots, connected through the Internet, that can be controlled by a malicious individual or group. It can have tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of bots that are typically controlled through a command and control server., These bots can be activated to distribute malware, launch DDoS attacks, distribute spam email, or execute brute-force password attacks. Cybercriminals will often rent out botnets to third parties for nefarious purposes., Many organizations. like Cisco, force network activities through botnet traffic filters to identify any botnet locations., Select the image to find out more., , , On-path attackers intercept or modify communications between two devices, such as a web browser and a web server, either to collect information from or to impersonate one of the devices., This type of attack is also referred to as a man-in-the-middle or man-in-the-mobile attack., Select the images to find out more about these., A MitM attack happens when a cybercriminal takes control of a device without the user’s knowledge. With this level of access, an attacker can intercept and capture user information before it is sent to its intended destination. These types of attacks are often used to steal financial information., There are many types of malware that possess MitM attack capabilities., , A variation of man-in-middle, MitMo is a type of attack used to take control over a user’s mobile device. When infected, the mobile device is instructed to exfiltrate user-sensitive information and send it to the attackers. ZeuS is one example of a malware package with MitMo capabilities. It allows attackers to quietly capture two-step verification SMS messages that are sent to users., , There are a lot of ways for cybercriminals to infiltrate your systems and networks, but it’s important that you know what these are., Let’s keep going!, You’ve probably heard of search engine optimization or SEO which, in simple terms, is about improving an organization’s website so that it gains greater visibility in search engine results., So what do you think SEO poisoning might be? Take a moment to consider this and when you’re ready, select the image to find out if you were right!, Search engines such as Google work by presenting a list of web pages to users based on their search query. These web pages are ranked according to the relevancy of their content., While many legitimate companies specialize in optimizing websites to better position them, attackers take advantage of popular search terms and use SEO to push malicious sites higher up the ranks of search results. This technique is called SEO poisoning., The most common goal of SEO poisoning is to increase traffic to malicious sites that may host malware or attempt social engineering., , You’re enjoying your lunch in the canteen when a colleague approaches you. They seem distressed., They explain that they can’t seem to connect to the public Wi-Fi on their phone and ask if you have the private Wi-Fi password to hand so that they can check that their phone is working., How would you respond?, Select the correct answer, then Submit., Entering a username and password is one of the most popular forms of authenticating to a web site. Therefore, uncovering your password is an easy way for cybercriminals to gain access to your most valuable information., Select the headings to find out more about some of the common password security attacks., This technique attempts to gain access to a system by ‘spraying’ a few commonly used passwords across a large number of accounts. For example, a cybercriminal uses 'Password123' with many usernames before trying again with a second commonly-used password, such as ‘qwerty.’, This technique allows the perpetrator to remain undetected as they avoid frequent account lockouts., A hacker systematically tries every word in a dictionary or a list of commonly used words as a password in an attempt to break into a password-protected account., The simplest and most commonly used way of gaining access to a password-protected site, brute-force attacks see an attacker using all possible combinations of letters, numbers and symbols in the password space until they get it right., Passwords in a computer system are not stored as plain text, but as hashed values (numerical values that uniquely identify data). A rainbow table is a large dictionary of precomputed hashes and the passwords from which they were calculated., Unlike a brute-force attack that has to calculate each hash, a rainbow attack compares the hash of a password with those stored in the rainbow table. When an attacker finds a match, they identify the password used to create the hash., Plain text or unencrypted passwords can be easily read by other humans and machines by intercepting communications., If you store a password in clear, readable text, anyone who has access to your account or device, whether authorized or unauthorized, can read it., It looks as if the hackers are trying everything to crack @Apollo’s private Wi-Fi password. We have to make sure that the password is strong enough to withstand their attack!, Take a look at the following passwords. Click the numbers to put them in the correct order according to how long you think it would take an attacker to crack each one using brute-force, where 1 is the shortest amount of time and 4, the highest., Attackers also achieve infiltration through advanced persistent threats (APTs) — a multi-phase, long term, stealthy and advanced operation against a specific target. For these reasons, an individual attacker often lacks the skill set, resources or persistence to perform APTs., Due to the complexity and the skill level required to carry out such an attack, an APT is usually well-funded and typically targets organizations or nations for business or political reasons., Its main purpose is to deploy customized malware on one or more of the target’s systems and remain there undetected., Phew! That’s a lot to take in and hackers certainly have a lot of tools at their disposal. It is important that you know what these are so that you can protect yourself and @Apollo., You think back to some of the suspicious activities that you’ve seen recently in the organization.

"[Module 2: Attacks, Concepts and Techniques | 3. Security Vulnerability and Exploits]","[What makes an organization vulnerable to attack, Scroll to begin , Before we get into the details, let’s start by outlining some key terms that you need to know., Security vulnerabilities are any kind of software or hardware defect. A program written to take advantage of a known vulnerability is referred to as an exploit. A cybercriminal can use an exploit against a vulnerability to carry out an attack, the goal of which is to gain access to a system, the data it hosts or a specific resource., Hardware vulnerabilities are most often the result of hardware design flaws. For example, the type of memory called RAM basically consists of lots of capacitors (a component which can hold an electrical charge) installed very close to one another. However, it was soon discovered that, due to their close proximity, changes applied to one of these capacitors could influence neighbor capacitors. Based on this design flaw, an exploit called Rowhammer was created. By repeatedly accessing (hammering) a row of memory, the Rowhammer exploit triggers electrical interferences that eventually corrupt the data stored inside the RAM., Google security researchers discovered Meltdown and Spectre, two hardware vulnerabilities that affect almost all central processing units (CPUs) released since 1995 within desktops, laptops, servers, smartphones, smart devices and cloud services., Attackers exploiting these vulnerabilities can read all memory from a given system (Meltdown), as well as data handled by other applications (Spectre). The Meltdown and Spectre vulnerability exploitations are referred to as side-channel attacks (information is gained from the implementation of a computer system). They have the ability to compromise large amounts of memory data because the attacks can be run multiple times on a system with very little possibility of a crash or other error., Hardware vulnerabilities are specific to device models and are not generally exploited through random compromising attempts. While hardware exploits are more common in highly targeted attacks, traditional malware protection and good physical security are sufficient protection for the everyday user., Software vulnerabilities are usually introduced by errors in the operating system or application code., Select the logo to find out more about the SYNful Knock vulnerability discovered in Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS) in 2015., The SYNful Knock vulnerability allowed attackers to gain control of enterprise-grade routers, such as the legacy Cisco ISR routers, from which they could monitor all network communication and infect other network devices., This vulnerability was introduced into the system when an altered IOS version was installed on the routers. To avoid this, you should always verify the integrity of the downloaded IOS image and limit the physical access of such equipment to authorized personnel only., , Most software security vulnerabilities fall into several main categories., Select the headings to find out what these are., Buffers are memory areas allocated to an application. A vulnerability occurs when data is written beyond the limits of a buffer. By changing data beyond the boundaries of a buffer, the application can access memory allocated to other processes. This can lead to a system crash or data compromise, or provide escalation of privileges., Programs often require data input, but this incoming data could have malicious content, designed to force the program to behave in an unintended way., For example, consider a program that receives an image for processing. A malicious user could craft an image file with invalid image dimensions. The maliciously crafted dimensions could force the program to allocate buffers of incorrect and unexpected sizes., This vulnerability describes a situation where the output of an event depends on ordered or timed outputs. A race condition becomes a source of vulnerability when the required ordered or timed events do not occur in the correct order or at the proper time., Systems and sensitive data can be protected through techniques such as authentication, authorization and encryption. Developers should stick to using security techniques and libraries that have already been created, tested and verified and should not attempt to create their own security algorithms. These will only likely introduce new vulnerabilities., Access control is the process of controlling who does what and ranges from managing physical access to equipment to dictating who has access to a resource, such as a file, and what they can do with it, such as read or change the file. Many security vulnerabilities are created by the improper use of access controls., Nearly all access controls and security practices can be overcome if an attacker has physical access to target equipment. For example, no matter the permission settings on a file, a hacker can bypass the operating system and read the data directly off the disk. Therefore, to protect the machine and the data it contains, physical access must be restricted, and encryption techniques must be used to protect data from being stolen or corrupted., The goal of software updates is to stay current and avoid exploitation of vulnerabilities. Microsoft, Apple and other operating system producers release patches and updates almost every day and applications such as web browsers, mobile apps and web servers are often updated by the companies or organizations responsible for them., Despite the fact that organizations put a lot of effort into finding and patching software vulnerabilities, new vulnerabilities are discovered regularly. That’s why some organizations use third party security researchers who specialize in finding vulnerabilities in software, or actually invest in their own penetration testing teams dedicated to search, find and patch software vulnerabilities before they can get exploited., Google’s Project Zero is a great example of this practice. After discovering a number of vulnerabilities in various software used by end users, Google formed a permanent team dedicated to finding software vulnerabilities. You can find out more about Google’s security research here., This has made you think about some of the vulnerabilities that may exist at @Apollo. After some investigation you’ve noted some potential issues., Can you identify what category each of these vulnerabilities falls into? You have a chance to earn some defender points here and further safeguard @Apollo, so take your time., Choose the correct answer from each of the dropdowns, then Submit., You need to be constantly aware of security vulnerabilities around you so that you can respond accordingly. But remember, the cybersecurity landscape is continually evolving. For example, cryptojacking — a type of cyber attack used to mine cryptocurrency — is on the rise., Select Next to continue.]"
